# Observation based Advisory prediction

Advisory is an experimental position risk indicator at a frozen reference time.
It is independent of Current Monitor motion authorization. Default posterior
proxy participation is disabled. No calibration or future error guarantee is asserted.

`PredictorModule::admission` owns pose/frame/reference checks and per-source
eligibility. GNSS requires fresh matching monitored epoch/FDE identity; a motion
quality failure alone does not invalidate that GNSS identity. LiDAR requires its
frozen observation support time and available geometry. Fusion can use either;
explicit source modes never switch source. Callers preserve monitor fields and
project the module result into the existing GridMap statuses. Physical map
filtering and actual motion/publication checks remain separate authorities.

A source PSD matrix can participate without a standalone PL. The unregularized
joint 3D map/ENU position information must have observable rank. Epsilon's weak
direction contribution must be at most 1%; a dominated or rank deficient solve
has no official HPL/VPL. Its finite inverse is exported only as a diagnostic.
Source and joint information PL use K_H sqrt(max_eigenvalue(C_xy)) and
K_V sqrt(C_zz), plus the named bias/reserve. GNSS raw hypothesis PL and anchored
monitor PL are distinct diagnostic quantities, never reconstructed into FIM.
The shared result carries numerical status, original eigenvalues and weak
direction; GridMap does not store per-cell matrices.

Frozen inputs write `iap_prediction_input_v2`; v1 remains readable for historical
diagnostics. New numerical parameters are serialized and hashed in the input
identity. Historic payloads are not relabelled as new real recordings. Prediction
queries use saved reference time. Per-source expiry never grants renewed
freshness; cache lifetime ends before an admitted source expires.

Verification: predictor/codec/paired fixture regressions. Forest scans, independent
95% empirical error coverage, and mission acceptance require clean committed
live trials, and remain pending while the workspace is blocked.
