# IAP Conventions (强约定)

## 1) GNSS tight coupling conventions
- Measurement residual definition:
  - Pseudorange: r_rho = meas - pred
  - Doppler:     r_D   = meas - pred
- Doppler unit: m/s (not Hz)
- Satellite position/velocity source: broadcast ephemeris
- Receiver clock:
  - clock bias δt in seconds (or meters via c*δt, but must be consistent)
  - clock drift δt_dot in s/s (or m/s via c*δt_dot)

## 2) LiDAR backend conventions
- Use GLIM ICP pipeline as baseline for LiDAR constraints.
- Health monitoring:
  - Detect degeneracy / mismatch per scan factor
  - Convert to noise inflation gamma_lidar (>=1) and/or drop factor

## 3) Visibility/observability prediction conventions
- GNSS visibility set V^:
  - Must use point-cloud/map-based occlusion model (ray-based LOS check)
  - Elevation mask allowed (optional), but cannot be the only model
- LiDAR observability set O^:
  - Baseline: use map-based proxy for “ICP observability/quality” (may include occlusion)
  - Trunk landmarks: optional upgrade (not required for baseline)

## 4) Covariance/Integrity propagation conventions
- Baseline propagation: empirical covariance growth model (Σ growth)
- Keep an interface for exact propagation/update:
  - S = H Σ H^T + R
  - (optional) Σ update with Kalman-style measurement information
- Planning uses PL_pred derived from Σ_pred (proxy) in baseline
